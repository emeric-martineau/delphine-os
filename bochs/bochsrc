#=======================================================================
# LOG CONTROLS
#
# Bochs now has four severity levels for event logging.
#   panic: cannot proceed.  If you choose to continue after a panic, 
#          don't be surprised if you get strange behavior or crashes.
#   error: something went wrong, but it is probably safe to continue the
#          simulation.
#   info: interesting or useful messages.
#   debug: messages useful only when debugging the code.  This may
#          spit out thousands per second.
#
# For events of each level, you can choose to crash, report, or ignore.
# TODO: allow choice based on the facility: e.g. crash on panics from
#       everything except the cdrom, and only report those.
#
# If you are experiencing many panics, it can be helpful to change
# the panic action to report instead of fatal.  However, be aware
# that anything executed after a panic is uncharted territory and can 
# cause bochs to become unstable.  The panic is a "graceful exit," so
# if you disable it you may get a spectacular disaster instead.
