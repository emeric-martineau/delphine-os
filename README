                        Information about DelphineOS:
                        -----------------------------


Keep in mind that DelphineOS is still under developpement and in early beta
stage. If you have comments, critics, improvements, problems or whatever,

Goal:
-----

DelphineOS is a kernel for x86 CPUs. We first made it to learn system
programming.

It implements multitasking, virtual memory, ...

We try to make it POSIX compliant.

It's written in pascal and assembler using the Free Pascal Compiler
(www.freepascal.org) and nasm () under GNU/Linux and is distributed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License (www.gnu.org).




Installation:
-------------

If you want to run DelphineOS, you have to use Bochs (bochs.sourceforge.net).
DelphineOS can boot from a floppy or from a hard drive partition but it's
better to use Bochs because it's the easiest way of testing it.

You have to run ./install (as root) from the directory in which DelphineOS is
installed. This script offers 3 choices :

	1 - Make a disk image for Bochs
	2 - Make a bootable floppy
	3 - Install on a hd partition

If you choose the 1st, a file called delphineOS.img will be created in the
"bochs/" directory. You have to correctly configure Bochs to launch it (this
file is a bootable hard drive image).

If you choose the 2nd, just insert an ext2-formatted floppy in /dev/fd0 and
reboot with it.

If you choose the 3rd, DelphineOS will installed on a hd partition. This
partition has to be ext2-formatted. You can launch it with LILO using a
configuration similar to a DOS/Windows partition.

The installation script creates a script called "flagger" which is used to
compile C programs for DelphineOS using gcc. For example, if you want to compile
a program which uses a Makefile, type : make CC=flagger (you must verify that
the Makefile use $(CC) and doesn't directly call the C compiler).




IMPORTANT NOTES (If you have made a bootable floppy) :
------------------------------------------------------

If you get "Loading DelphineOS...  C", when booting from the disk, please format
your disk with bad-blocks checking (mke2fs /dev/fd0 -c). The "C" means the
loader can't read the floppy (probably because of a bad block).
The system will crash because we haven't got a floppy driver. So, we can't read
files from the floppy disk. Conclusion: use the bootable floppy to see if your
hardware is correctly detected by DelphineOS.



Limitations:
------------

For the moment, DelphineOS can't use :

	- SCSI devices
	- Network devices
	- Sound cards
	- Mouse device
	- Graphic video modes


Processes can't be bigger than 1Go (should be ok...)
DelphineOS only supports ext2 filesystems (may be ext3, not tested).
